# Agile Implementation Management 

## Purpose
This application is an example for the stack BOPF/FPM/FBI.
It realizes a simple task-amanagement tool for Projects.

Multiple branches may provide different states of the application as it evolves along with the base-technology.

## Pre-requisites
[https://github.com/larshp/abapGit](ABAPGit) and the [https://github.com/larshp/abapGit-plugins](plugins) are needed to deploy this application to your ABAP System.

## System-components
All samples are based on BOPF. This has been part of the business suite foundation in ECC 6.0 EhP6 and migrated into the Netweaver layer with 7.50. If your system does not meet the requirements, I recommend to get a system from the [http://cal.sap.com](SAP Cloud Appliance Library) which is easiest to set-up.
